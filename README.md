# PGRP-master
My custom-written server that utilizes a number of my own scripts for providing players a fun and engaging experience. Game: Garry's Mod, DarkRP. Project written completely in LUA with elements of PHP and simple CSS, for a Russian speaking audience.

If you are reading this - you've been granted special access to my project. I keep all my code away from public because of the sheer amount of copycats ready to jump at your work. 
I hope this code means something to you (or me, maybe you are my future college looking at the projects that compile together to form a statement about my programming knowledge!), so please look through every part of this!

-> addons/mopache-stuff -> public addons released on the Steam Workshop
-> addons/darkrpmodification -> lua -> modules -> this is my sacred work, all my self-written lua code!
*there are some scripts that aren't mine, they are marked as not mine inside comments!

Thank you for purchasing DarkRP City Worker! <3

== SETUP ==
1) Place the "cityworker" folder in the "garrysmod/addons" folder
2) Configure the addon in the configuration file located in addons/cityworker/lua/autorun/cityworker_config.lua
3) If you want to use a custom configuration, use the configurator SWEP to setup your custom map tasks! If you are running rp_downtown_v4c_v2, there is already a preset configuration!
4) Restart your server or change the map.

== CONSOLE COMMANDS ==
Here are the console commands for setting up the DarkRP City Worker with your server:

	cw_removeall | Removes all positions on the map the server is loaded into.
	cw_removeallmaps | Removes ALL POSITIONS from ALL MAPS. Basically just clears the save file.

== ADVANCED ==
The configuration for specific positions, tweaking and removing, can be found in the cityworker.txt file under garrysmod/data once you load the game up.
